 * Hearts stylesheet
 *
 */

/*

    This is the CSS stylesheet of your game User Interface.
    
    Styles defined on this file will be applied to the HTML elements you defined in your
    HTML template (hearts_hearts.tpl), and to HTML elements you create dynamically
    (in hearts.js).
    
    Usually, you are using CSS to:
    
    1°) define the overall layout of your game
        (ex: place the board on the top left, place player's hand beside, place the deck on the right, ...).

    2°) create your CSS-sprites:
        All images of your games should be gathered into a small number of image files. Then, using
        background-image and background-position CSS properties, you create HTML blocks that can 
        display these images correctly (see example below).
    
    3°) ... anything else:
        This is really easy to add and remove CSS classes dynamically from your Javascript with
        dojo.addClass and dojo.removeClass. This is also easy to check if an element has a class
        (dojo.hasClass) or to get all elements with a specific class (dojo.query). This is why,
        very often, using CSS classes for the logic of your user interface allow you to do complex
        thing easyly.
        
        
     Note: on the production platform, this file will be compressed and comments will be remove.
           Consequently, don't hesitate to put as many comments as necessary.
